            How to Play Fantasy Cricket on Think11?
          </h2>
          <span className="fn-24 mt-3">
            To play fantasy cricket league on Think11, follow the below-mentioned steps:
          </span>

          <ul className="font-18 poppins-regular my-3 fw-300 playlist mt-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="450">
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              If you are a newbie to Think11, ensure that you register yourself or simply log in to the platform and select the fantasy cricket option.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Next, you need to tap on the ‘Create Team’ button for the league or match that you want to participate in.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              This is the most important step of all, which involves creating a team of 11 players, including a captain and vice-captain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Next, make a choice between participating in a free or cash contest.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              If you choose a cash contest, your next step would be to pay the entry fee using one of the payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, net banking, or PayTM.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>

            Fantasy Cricket Tips
          </h2>
          <span className="fn-24 mt-3">
            To boost your chances of winning exciting rewards and cash prizes in fantasy cricket leagues, leverage the below-mentioned fantasy cricket tips:
          </span>

          <ul className="font-18 poppins-regular my-3 fw-300 playlist mt-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="450">
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Consider playing only some matches at a time. Participate only in those cricket leagues in which you have decent knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Never join a league 5–10 minutes before the deadline. Consider joining at least 1 to 2 hours such that it gives time to plan for injuries or sudden squad changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Before you create the team, ensure that you conduct in-depth research, including a weather report, ground conditions, pitch report, player statistics, and their current form.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Don’t invest your full money in the initial phase; consider playing in small leagues or cricket leagues with a lower entry fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Ensure that you have some basic cricket knowledge, conduct some research regarding players, and do not rely on YouTube videos or apps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Search for low-level competitors based on the captain and vice-captain you have chosen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              Consider participating in cricket matches or leagues with multiple teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
              </span>
              On the Think11 app, you might choose the 11 best players for your fantasy cricket team. But ensure that you choose the finest possible combination.

                <img src={checkmart} alt="Checkmark" />
