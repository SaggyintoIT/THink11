              Fantasy football is a virtual game that involves creating a team of 11 real-life players, including midfielders, goalkeepers, defenders, and 
              strikers. They compete against other teams with fantasy football players. You also need to choose the best captain and vice-captain for your 
              team since the captain fetches twice the points and the vice-captain gets 1.5 times the fantasy points. At the end, the team with the highest 
              scores is declared the winner. Basically, fantasy football is a game of skill where a combination of analysis, prediction, and knowledge can 
              help you win. Also, it is advisable to conduct thorough research before creating your fantasy football team.
